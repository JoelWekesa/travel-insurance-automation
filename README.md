## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'playwright'`**
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

**Issue: Slack notifications not being sent**

- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check internet connectivity
- Test webhook manually:
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
--data '{"text":"Test message"}' \
YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

**Issue: `Error: Element is not visible`**

- The page may be loading slowly
- Increase timeout values:
```python
page.wait_for_timeout(1000)  # Increase from 500
```

**Issue: File upload fails**

- Ensure `download.jpeg` exists in the project directory
- Check file permissions
- Verify file path is correct

**Issue: Selector not found**

- The website may have changed
- Use Playwright codegen to regenerate selectors:
```bash
playwright codegen https://www.oldmutual.co.ke/app/public/travel-insurance
```

**Issue: Test runs but no notifications on phone**

- Check Slack app notifications are enabled in phone settings
- Verify channel notification settings in Slack app
- Test by sending a manual message to the channel

### Debug Mode

To see detailed logs, add verbose logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
